So far, I have learned...
1. HTML, including layout, links, tables, forms, and many other tags
2. CSS basics and selection, changing properties/values, and the use of 
various frameworks in making work easier
3. Basic setup, basically installing the needed software (like this one, 
Git Bash)
4. Command line commands including using nano and manipulating the 
environment
5. Getting the hang of GIT currently!
